# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project has many different data points and criteria that can be used to analyze campaign fundraising goals and outcomes.  

### Purpose
The specific purpose of this project was to analyze campaign outcomes in comparison to launch date and funding goals.  

## Analysis and Challenges
I performed my analysis by using several different methods and ways to analyze information in excel, including pivot tables, excel formulas, and charts.  One of the challenges of the data is that there are so many different categories and subcategories to choose from, so it helped to analyze the data by specific categories.

#### One challenge I had was with my conditional ifs formula. I had some difficulties getting it to work, but upon trial and error, was able to get the formula correct.  One common mistake of mine is to include a space in between parts of the formula.
#### One additional challenge I encountered was with my second graph. Upon trial and error, I found I had used the stacked line graph instead of the standard line graph.

## Results

### Conclusions on Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date:
1.  The number of successful theatres was higher in the late spring and early summer months.  
2.  The number of failed theatres did not change very significantly from month to month.  
3.  There were very few canceled theatres.

### Conclusions on Play Outcomes Based on Goals:
1.  Overall, most smaller fundraising goals have a higher percentage of successful plays than failed plays.
2.  Very large fundraising goals had a high failure percentage.

### Limitations of Data Set:
There could be many factors contributing to the success or failure rate of the campaigns.  Some of these factors could include differences by country, months, types of categories, etc. While we do have all of this information, our specific analysis did not compare different variables.  For instance, we could compare only theatres and plays of a certain pledge size.  There could also be differences due to geographical locations across each country, the United State for example.  Perhaps more successful plays are on the east coast compared to the west coast.  

### Additional tables and/or graphs that we could create:
1.  We could add in additional geographical information including state.
2.  We could also compare the average donation compared to the successful percentage to see if there is a correlation between the information.
