# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project has many different data points and criteria that can be used to analyze campaign data and outcomes.  

### Purpose
The specific purpose of this project was to analyze campaign outcomes in comparison to launch date and funding goals.  For the purposes of this analysis, we are focused on the subcategory of plays only.  

## Analysis and Challenges
I performed my analysis by using several different methods and ways to analyze information in excel, including pivot tables, excel formulas, and charts.  One of the challenges of the data is that there were so many differnet categories and subcategories to choose from, so it helped to analyze the data by different categories as shown in two specific analyses I performed below. 
  One challenge I had was with my conditional ifs formula. I had some difficulties getting it to work, but upon trial and error, was able to get the formula correct.  One common mistake of mine is to include a space in betweeen parts of the formula.
  One additional challenge I encountered was with my second graph. Upon trial and error, I found I had used the stacked line graph instead of the standard line graph.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
